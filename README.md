# CP Companion

CP Companion is a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application designed for Competitive Programming enthusiasts. It tracks upcoming coding contests from various platforms (Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef, AtCoder, etc.) via the [Clist API](https://clist.by/) and presents them through a sleek, glassmorphic UI. It also features a "Rainmeter-style" borderless desktop widget to keep the next upcoming contest constantly visible with a live countdown.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application is built using the **Tauri framework**, combining a high-performance Rust backend with a modern React frontend. 

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Zustand, Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: Rust, Tauri v2.
- **Local Storage**: SQLite (via `rusqlite`).
- **External API**: Clist.by API v4.

### System Design & Data Flow

The architecture is designed to minimize external API calls (preventing rate limiting) while keeping multiple windows (Main App, Desktop Widget) perfectly synchronized.

1. **State & Synchronization Strategy**:
   - The **Main Window** periodically triggers auto-sync (every 5 minutes) to fetch external network requests from a dedicated proxy backend. When it fetches new contests, the Rust backend immediately caches these results into a local SQLite database stored in the OS's AppData directory.
   - The **Rainmeter Widget Window** operates independently. Instead of making redundant external API requests, it listens for Tauri IPC events and periodically polls the local SQLite cache (every 5 seconds). This ensures perfectly synchronized views across multiple windows without creating race conditions.

2. **Window Management**:
   - The application manages multiple Tauri Webview Windows (`main` and `widget`). 
   - `App.tsx` conditionally renders different component trees based on the window label (`getCurrentWindow().label`). If the label is `widget`, it renders the `RainmeterWidget` component; otherwise, it renders the main application interface.
   - The app uses `tauri-plugin-single-instance` to ensure only one instance of the backend runs at a time. If a user tries to launch the app again, it simply brings the existing main window to focus.

3. **Background Execution & System Tray**:
   - When the user closes the main window, the application intercepts the close event (`WindowEvent::CloseRequested`) and hides the window instead of terminating the process.
   - The app resides in the system tray, allowing the desktop widget and background synchronization to continue running seamlessly.

## 📂 Project Structure & Core Modules

### 1. Frontend (`/src`)

- **`App.tsx`**: The main routing and layout component. It handles window detection logic, orchestrates background auto-syncs (every 5 minutes), and ensures cross-window theme synchronization.
- **`stores/useContestStore.ts`**: Global state management powered by Zustand. It orchestrates the Tauri IPC calls to fetch and load cached contests from the Rust backend.
- **`components/`**:
  - `RainmeterWidget.tsx`: The borderless, draggable overlay. Features a custom 1-second interval hook for the live countdown timer, and listens for both IPC events and local SQLite cache polling to stay in sync.
  - `WidgetView.tsx` & `ContestCard.tsx`: Standard list view of upcoming contests.
  - `CalendarView.tsx`: A grid-based calendar visualization of the contest schedule.

### 2. Backend (`/src-tauri/src`)

- **`lib.rs`**: The core Tauri setup and entry point.
  - Initializes plugins (`autostart`, `opener`, `single_instance`).
  - Bootstraps the SQLite database and injects the connection pool into Tauri's managed state (`AppState`).
  - Registers the System Tray menu and defines its event handlers.
  - Exposes Tauri Commands (IPC endpoints) to the frontend: `fetch_contests`, `get_cached_contests`, `get_api_config`, `save_api_config`, and `open_main_app`.
- **`clist.rs`**: Handles external network communication. Uses the `reqwest` crate to query a custom proxy API, fetches available platforms dynamically, parses the JSON response using `serde`, and normalizes datetime formats.
- **`database.rs`**: The persistence layer. Uses `rusqlite` to manage the local `cp_companion.db`. 
  - Maintains two tables: `contests` (caching contest metadata) and `app_settings` (storing user preferences like preferred platforms and UI theme).
  - Handles replacing cache content and updating local settings securely.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Rust (latest stable)

### Installation & Development

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```
   *This starts the Vite dev server and compiles the Rust backend in debug mode.*

3. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```
   *This generates the optimized release binary and installer for your OS.*

## ⚙️ Configuration

CP Companion requires no complicated API keys or setups. The application automatically fetches live contest data through a dedicated proxy server. 

### Customizing your experience:
1. Launch the **CP Companion** desktop application.
2. Click on the **Settings** (gear icon) located in the main navigation bar.
3. Adjust your preferred application theme (System/Light/Dark) and Autostart preferences.
4. Select your preferred competitive programming platforms (e.g., Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, GeeksforGeeks) from the dynamic list.

🎉 **You're all set!** The application will save your preferences automatically and fetch the upcoming contests for your selected platforms, keeping them seamlessly synchronized with the desktop widget.
